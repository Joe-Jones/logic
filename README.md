logic
=====
This is program for the [schematic capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematic_capture) and
[simulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit_simulation) of digital electronic
circuits built out of [logic gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate). It is hosted at
[www.digitalschematic.org](http://www.digitalschematic.org/).

This software is a toy. It may be useful for educational purposes but it is certainly not a tool
suitable for professional engineers and probably not engineering students either. You will
hopefully have a lot of fun playing with it though.

In it's current state this software is experimental, data loss is almost guaranteed.
The author is not going to help you recover lost schematics.
